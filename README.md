### KML Format (Hema Explorer App)
- [Waypoints & Tracks](https://bitbucket.org/patros/glass-house-mountains-4wd-mapping/raw/master/KML/Glass%20House%20Waypoints%20&%20Tracks.kml)

KML files can be imported from the menu on the Hema Explorer App. The easiest
way to do this is to email the file to yourself and then save the attachment on
your phone. At the moment uploading this file directly to the Hema Cloud doesn't
work.


### OziExplorer Format (Hema Navigator)
Copy both of the map files to the "OziExplorer Maps" directory on your sd card.

- [Ozf4 Map File](https://bitbucket.org/patros/glass-house-mountains-4wd-mapping/raw/master/OziExplorer/Beerburrum%20HQP.ozf4)
